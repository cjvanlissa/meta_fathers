"1 (separed) perception when the parent either viewed the task as his/her own, or else he/she saw the task as the child’s and thus left the child toperform the task with hardly any help. 1 (joint) perception of the task was when the parent collaborated with the child and gave the impression that the task was a joint task.",,1
"3-point scale was used for morpho-phonology, rhyming and medial/final letters: (1) no reference; (2) reference without explanation (e.g. ‘this is a final M’); and (3) reference with explanation",,1
"3-point scale: (1) Low – the parent cannot keep the child on task. (2) Medium – the child may argue with the parent but eventually the parent makes the child accept his/her suggestion. (3) High – the parent suggests, and the child simply accepts the parent’s suggestion or direction.",,1

"5-point scale: (1) parent writes the letter on his/her own; (2) parent holds the child’s hand and produces the letter together with the child; (3) parent writes and the child copies the letter; (4) parent scaffolds the child in writing the letter (e.g. ‘this letter looks like a circle’ or ‘it’s the first letter in your name’) and (5) child writes the letter on his/her own, usually encouraged by parent. Again, it looks more like categorical rather than rank-ordered. ",,1

"coding scheme (Brady-Smith, O’Brien, Berlin, & Ware, 1999) included the following six scales of parent behavior: sensitivity (taking the child’s perspective, accurate perception of the child’s signals, and prompt and appropriate responses to these signals), positive regard (demonstration of love, respect, and admiration), cognitive stimulation (teaching or actively trying to expand the child’s abilities), detachment (lack of attention to and awareness of the child’s cues and absence of engagement in the child), negative regard (hostility towards or rejection of the child) and intrusiveness (physical or verbal overcontrol of the child’s play) ",,1
